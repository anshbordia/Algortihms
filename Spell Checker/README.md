This folder contains different implementations of a spell checker and an accompanying dictionary:
1) Using Global Edit Distance
2) Using Local Edit Distance
3) Using N-Grams
4) Using Editex

To test, give a csv file of misspelled/or correctly spelled words. An output will be generated for all the misspelt words with the best match from the dictionary.
