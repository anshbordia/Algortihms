Sentiment Analysis:

1) On Restaurant Dataset:
  
  - To determine if a review is positive or negative.
  - Simply run the Python script sentiment_rest.py and the model will run on the dataset. 
  - You can also add your own reviews in the dataset.
  - Naive Bayes used.

2) On Twitter Dataset:
  
  - To determine if a tweet is postive, negative or neutral.
  - Done using Weka. 
  - See the attached report on how to do this in Weka.
  - Train, test, and validation files in text format provided. Please refer to the references in the report to understand more about the       dataset in case of any doubts. These can be used if you don't want to use Weka.
  - I have also converted train, test, and validation files in ARFF for ease of input into Weka. 
  - This Tweet sentiment prediction task is done as part of the subject Knowledge Technologies at University of Melbourne.
